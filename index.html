                <p>Life is a test, and Allah has decreed different situations for all people to see who is best in deed. So in a nutshell, our main goal is to worship Allah in the manner he deserves to be worshipped in, and by doing this we gain tranquility in our hearts because we believe as muslims, the want or yearning to worship something is a intrinsic part of the human make up</p>

            <h1>Global Community</h1>
            <p>So as muslims we are ordered to pay 5 times a day, and to learn our book by way of the teachings of the prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him and implement knowledge that we seek in the plethora of books written on Islam, Islam tells us to pray the 5 daily prayers and to give the yearly alms tax to the poor, to fast in the month of Ramadan and to make the painstaking pilgrimage to Mecca for the Hajj once in one's life if he is able to do so.</p>
